## Introduction & Importance ❗

- Bash is an integral command-line tool to interact with the computer.
- A Bash Script is a file that contains a series of commands you want the computer to execute automatically

Bash Scripting is a major constituent for Automation of Tasks which in-turn builds and boosts effiencency as you can get small, repetitive tasks done automatically. 
It is also fundamental in management of files, installation of sofrware and system configurations.

## Learning Experience 🪴

Learning Bash Scripting has been intriguing, due to the variety of functions, uses and ability to generate automation of tasks on the Linux Shell through the construction of scripts. Starting off with the basic features of a script, I learnt about writing scripts with variables, using parameters, and delved into learning about if functions, while loops and error handling. This repo contains a summarised, yet essential guide from my learning journey whilst also showcasing hands-on practice (With explanations) of real-word tasks like backing up files, validating user input and more!

## What have I gained? 🔖

The biggest skill I’ve gained is problem-solving — breaking down a task into steps, translating it into commands, and debugging errors. I now see how Bash can save time and make workflows more efficient, and I’m looking forward to building on these skills as I continue deeper into Linux and DevOps tools.
