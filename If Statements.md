# ‚ùìIf Statements in Bash

`if` allows **decision-making** in scripts based on conditions.

## How it is done:

    if [ condition ]
    then
           echo "Hello" #Code to run if condition is met
    fi

## Examples

**üî¢ Number Comparison**
   
    age=25
    if [ $age -gt 18 ]
    then
      echo "You are an adult"
    fi

**üî° String Comparison**

    name="Uzair"
    if [ $name == "Uzair" ]
      echo "Hello Uzair"
    fi

**üß† Logical Operators**

    grade=80
    if [ $grade ge 90 ] && [ $grade le 100 ]
    then
      echo "Excellent"
    fi 

Note: In this case, there will be nothing printed as `85` is not greater/equal to 90. It is **only** less than 100.

**üîé Operators**

- `-eq` - equal to
- `-ne` - not equal to
- `-gt` - greater than
- `-lt` - less than
- `ge` - greater or equal
- `le` - less or equal
- `==` - **string** equals
- `!=` - **string** not equals
- `&&` = AND (for more than one condition)
- `||` = OR (for more than one condition)

# Else & Elif Clause

- `else` gives an alternative action when an `if` condition is false
- `elif` allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence when the preceding condition is false

## Examples

    age=16
    
    if [ $age -gt 18 ] 
    then 
        echo "You are an adult"
    elif [ $age -gt 13 ]
    then
        echo "You are a Teenager"
    else 
        echo "You are not a Teenager or Adult"
    fi
        

## Key Notes
- `if` statements allow conditional logic
-  Use `[ ]` with proper spacing
-  Combine multiple conditions with `&&` and `||`
