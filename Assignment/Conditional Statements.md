    if [ -r "$FILE" ]; then
        echo "This file exists and is readable"
    fi 
    
    if [ -w "$FILE" ]; then
        echo "This file exists and is writeable"
    fi 
    
    if [ -x "$FILE" ]; then 
        echo "This file exists and is executable"

## ‚úÖ What You Learned

* **`[ -f "$FILE" ]`** ‚Üí Checks if a regular file exists.
* **`[ -r "$FILE" ]`** ‚Üí Checks if file is **readable**.
* **`[ -w "$FILE" ]`** ‚Üí Checks if file is **writable**.
* **`[ -x "$FILE" ]`** ‚Üí Checks if file is **executable**.
* Nesting conditions lets you perform **permission checks only if the file exists**.
