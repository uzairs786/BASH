# 🧰 Variables

Variables are containers that store data (Strings, Numbers, Arrays)
They make your script dynamic and reusable 

## Creating a Variable with a String 

`greeting="Hello World"`

`echo $greeting`

## Numbers

`count=42`

`echo $count`

## Arrays

`fruits=("apple" "banana" "orange")`

`echo ${fruits[0]}` > This would output apple when running the script

## Variable Interpolation

`name="Uzair"`

`echo "Hello, $name`

## ❗Key Notes

- No space around `=`
- Use $ to reference the variable in your command
- Arrays use `()` and are accessed by `${array[index]}`
